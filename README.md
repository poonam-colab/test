The entire dataset contains csv files and json files(for different countries), including various kind of information like video titles, channels, video categories, publish time, number of views, number of likes and dislikes, etc.
Firstly, we count the number of trending videos of different types at different times, with which we can see the fluctuation. We also plan to show the popularity of particular video types by examining the total views of different video types. Then, we evaluate how these attributes are associated with cultures in different countries. Finally, we calculate the ratio of likes to dislikes for every channel to show the viewersâ€™ attitudes towards them.
